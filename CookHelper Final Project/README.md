# CookHelperAlpha
Alpha Version of Cook Helper Project

This project corresponds to a final assesment for the course SEG 2105 at the university of Ottawa.

This project was created by team Team.getName()

This application is a cooking assistant with the main functionality of storing and displaying recipes inputted by the user.
On top of this, we have implemented several other amenities including a search function, edit function, random recipe
function, and more. This is all presented to the user through a top-level GUI designed to represent the University Of Ottawa's
official colours utilising a material design-like interface. We have focused on being as intuitive as possible while still
remaining simple and easy to understand. The goal is to have a very quick learning curve.


Basic description of each activity/layer of application

Home Page
This is the screen that the application will launch into. It contains all the main functionality of the program, along with
a large graphic for aesthetic purposes. The main activities are available at the bottom of the home page, including the 
search functionality, the "Surprise me" functionality, which is the ability to select a random recipe, and the ability to view
your recipe book.
